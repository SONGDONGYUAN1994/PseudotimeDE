\title{Perform Differential Expression Test on One Gene}
\usage{
pseudotimeDE(
  gene,
  ori.tbl,
  sub.tbl,
  mat,
  assay.use = "counts",
  model = c("nb", "zinb", "gaussian", "auto", "qgam"),
  k = 6,
  knots = c(0:5/5),
  fix.weight = TRUE,
  aicdiff = 10,
  seed = 123,
  quant = 0.5,
  usebam = FALSE,
  seurat.assay = "RNA"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{A string of gene name. It should be one of the row names in sce.}

\item{ori.tbl}{A tibble or dataframe which contains the original cells and pseudotime as two columns.}

\item{sub.tbl}{A list of tibbles or dataframes where each is the fit of a subsample. Each element is the same format as \code{ori.tbl}.}

\item{mat}{The input expression data. It can be:
(1) A SingleCellExperment object which contain the expression data;
(2) An matrix;
(3) A Seurat object which contain the expression data.
Its row names should be genes and col names should be cells.}

\item{assay.use}{The \code{assay} used in SingleCellExperiment or \code{slot} used in Seurat. Default is \code{counts}.}

\item{model}{A string of the model name. One of \code{nb}, \code{zinb}, \code{gaussian}, \code{auto} and \code{qgam}.}

\item{k}{A integer of the basis dimension. Default is 6. The reults are usually robust to different k; we recommend to use k from 5 to 10.}

\item{knots}{A numeric vector of the location of knots. Default is evenly distributed between 0 to 1. For instance, if your k = 6, and your range is [0, 10], then the position of knots should be \code{c(0:5)*(10-0)}.}

\item{fix.weight}{A logic variable indicating if the ZINB-GAM will use the zero weights from the original model. Used for saving time since ZINB-GAM is computationally intense.}

\item{aicdiff}{A numeric variable of the threshold of model selection. Only works when \code{model = `auto`}.}

\item{seed}{A numeric variable of the random seed. It mainly affects the parametricfitting of null distribution.}

\item{quant}{The quantile of interest for quantile regression (qgam), range from 0 to 1, default as 0.5.}

\item{usebam}{A logical variable. If use \code{mgcv::bam}, which may be faster with large sample size (e.g., > 10'000 cells).}

\item{seurat.assay}{The \code{assay} used in Seurat. Default is \code{'RNA'}.}
